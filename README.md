# Tensorflow-examples-cnn
In this repository, I put tensorflow codes that I Wrote when I am training my self of building models using tensorflow
 <br/>
 In __tranfer-laerning-inception.py__ file transfer learning using InceptionV3 pretrained model. To run this code, you 
 you need to have a folder named __data__ and the dataset and also pretrained model in it. the link to download the dataset 
 and pretrained inceptionv3 model is written in the code. 
<br/> 
One more thing in the code, at line 35 you can try different layers(up to mixed10)
